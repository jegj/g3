# G3

Gist Storage Service CLI. Just like AWS S3, G3 is lightweight and flexible
CLI that provides an easy way to store and access data with the reliability
of GitHubâ€™s infrastructure. G3 is perfect for developers who need a quick,
reliable, and Git-native way to manage small to medium-sized files without
setting up complex storage systems.

## Limitation

Since G3 relies in Github Gist API, do not use for really heavy files.
Gist limits the file size for a file in a Gist to 100MB. There is not a
strict limit for the number of files in a gist but there are some limits
for hitting the Github API per key

## Installation

## Configuration

```json
{
  "GITHUB_TOKEN": "github_22faketoken_asieowiafhjls2basdjnnmazxwa",
  "AES_KEY": "A37F1C5D92E46B88F021BD6734FAC95E127A45EF983DBC7609DD4F602A9183BF"
}
```

- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: A personal access token (PAT) used to authenticate requests
  to the GitHub API. This token should have the necessary permissions to
  read and write gists.

- `AES_KEY`: A 32-byte encryption key used for AES-256 encryption and
  decryption of stored data. This key ensures that sensitive information
  remains secure. Keep this key private and do not share it.

## Usage

```sh
g3 <command> [options]

Commands:
  g3 ls          Show all the files in your storage
  g3 cp <file>   Copy a file to your storage. If the file exists, it will be
                 overwritten.
  g3 get <file>  Get file from your storage
  g3 rm <file>   Delete file from your storage
